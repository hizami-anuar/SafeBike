## 1. Visibility of System Status

_The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time._

The pages have helpful headers that display what the user is currently viewing. When a user is reporting a blockage, the form displayed is labeled with "Report Blockage". The user should never be confused about what they are currently looking at on the page.

## 2. Match between System and the Real World

_The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order._

Our UI does not use complicated jargon, using simple and standard phrases to describe functionality such as edit and delete. The information that users are most likely to need are displayed right on the home page.

## 3. User Control and Freedom

_Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process._

Users have the ability to edit and delete blockages. They even have the ability to change their username, change their password, or delete their account. If a user accidentally clicks on the button to delete their account, a warning pops up that gives them a chanceto cancel.

## 4. Consistency and Standards

_Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions._

Our UI uses standard platform conventions, such as a pencil icon indicating an edit feature, and a trash icon indicating a delete feature. We use standard vocabulary for pages such as Home, Account, Settings, Login, Logout.

## 5. Error Prevention

_Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action._

Submission forms prevent the user from submitting if the input is not properly formatted, for example if they leave the username or password fields blank on the signup/login form.

## 6. Recognition rather than Recall

_Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed._

Most actions are immediately visible on the surface of the UI. No actions are hidden behind complex maneuvers or sequences of keypresses, and most actions don't even require the user to navigate a menu.

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

_Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions._

Our UI is designed to be easy and convenient, taking users only a few seconds to report blockages and to view blockages. Thus, there is very little about interaction with the website that requires shortcuts that speed up the process.

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

_Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility._

Our UI displays the most relevant information about blockages to the users. Irrelevant information like Blockage ID or Reporter ID are not displayed.

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

_Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution._

Our UI displays easily-understandable error messages that tell the user exactly how to fix the error, such as "Usernames cannot be more than 15 characters long" (no error codes or complicated jargon).

## 10. Help and Documentation

_It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks._

The system provides helpful instructions that tell the user how to use the functionality of the site. For example, "Double click on the map to create a new blockage".
